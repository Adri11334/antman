### Content
**binary name**: antman/antman + giantman/giantman<br>
**language**: C<br>
**build tool**: via Makefile, including re, all, clean, fclean rules
<br>

### Goal
The goal of this project is to compress data. You will write two programs. \
The first one will take a file as input and compress it. \
The second one will take a compressed file as input and translate it back to its original state

You must have 2 folders at the root of your repository: a folder named antman with a binary named antman
in it, and a folder named giantman with binary named giantman in it. \
Each folder must contain a Makefile compiling the corresponding binary and a Makefile at the root must
compile all binaries.
